# netspective-web-filter-v2
New version of Netspective Web Filter from Grom Education

---

Changes:

* Changed allowed platforms to Windows, ChromiumOS/ChromeOS, and Linux (Linux support is limited currently.)
* Added more Managed Enterprise Settings. (BETA! Here be dragons!)
* Started work on adding a Dark Theme because the original developers apparently didn't know Light Theme sucks.
